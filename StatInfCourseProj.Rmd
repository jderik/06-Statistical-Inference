### Statistical Inference Course Project : Part 1 / Simulations
#### by Joel
##### Overview
The objective 
 Investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. 
 
 To illustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials. 
1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

```{r}

lambda <- 0.2
n <- 1000
samples <- 40
set.seed(26)
generate_random <- replicate(n, rexp(samples, rate=lambda))

# Print structure of the simulation
str(generate_random)

#calculate  means of the exponential samples
exp_means<- apply(generate_random,2,mean)

#calculate standard deviation of the exponential samples
exp_sd<- sd(exp_means)

#calculate variance of the exponential samples
exp_var<- exp_sd ^ 2
```

#### 1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
Sample mean and Theoretical Mean is printed below respectively
```{r}
mean(exp_means)

# Theoretical mean
1/lambda
```

#####The sample mean comes to around 4.9 and the theoretical is at 5. These values indicate that the sample and theoretical mean are very close to each other. For infinite observations the sample and theory should match.



#### 2.Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.

Sample deviation  and Theoretical std deviation are printed below respectively
```{r}
exp_sd

(1/lambda)/(sqrt(samples))

```


Sample variance  and Theoretical variance are printed below respectively
```{r}
exp_var

((1/lambda)/(sqrt(samples)))^2
```

##### The standard deviation of the samples turns out to be 0.81. THe theoretical standard deviation has turned out to be 0.79. 


##### The sample variance has turned out to be 0.66 and theoretical variance is 0.62. 


#### 3.Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
```{r}
