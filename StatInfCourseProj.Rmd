### Statistical Inference Course Project : Part 1 / Simulations
#### by Joel
##### Overview
The objective 
 Investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. 
 
 To illustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials. 
1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

```{r}

lambda <- 0.2
n <- 1000
samples <- 40
set.seed(26)
sim <- replicate(n, rexp(samples, rate=lambda))

# Print structure of the simulation
str(sim)

#calculate  means of the exponential samples
exp_means<- apply(sim,2,mean)
```

#### 1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
Sample mean and Theoretical Mean is displayed below respectively
```{r}
mean(exp_means)
1/lambda
```

#####These values indicate that the sample and theoretical mean are virtually same.
